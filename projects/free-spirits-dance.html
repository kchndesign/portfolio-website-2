                <p>
                    Part of the business' strategy in 2021 was the development
                    of a new website that would suit a larger shift in
                    direction. To make sure that the website was
                    fit-for-purpose, it was designed from the ground up with a
                    product design mindset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This involved a lengthy design research phase, including
                    competitor analysis, UX wireframing, style guids, UX
                    prototypes and usability testing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These wireframes and mockups were eventually turned into
                    HTML and CSS layouts and populated with assets designed by
                    me using Photoshop and Illustrator.

                <p>
                    As the business achieved greater success, it was apparent
                    that some automation and integration was needed to save
                    their staff time with bookings and administrative work.
                    Their supplier at the time's product was not specific enough
                    for their business. After some deliberation, the solution
                    that was decided on was to build a lightweight web
                    application that would target the biggest pain point in
                    their operations.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In collaboration with product designer
                    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rsmao/" target="_blank"
                        >Mo</a
                    >, we designed and built an MVP with little time and
                    resources. Despite the limited budget, we were able to
                    transform the business's operations into something much more
                    scalable.

                />
                <h3>Free Spirits Logotype</h3>
                <p>
                    Free Spirits Dance Co. is a small business based in
                    Haymarket, Sydney that teaches dancing to small groups of
                    students. At the end of 2020, they approached me to help
                    them design a logotype that will help them promote their
                    business in photos and videos taken at their studio. The
                    project was to be completed in a short time-frame due to an
                    upcoming event.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After a few rounds of meetings with the business owners
                    discussing the image they wanted for their business, I
                    delivered a logotype that they were very happy with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The logotype was drawn in many iterations using markers and
                    tracing paper. It was then digitised in Adobe Illustrator.
                </p>
                <img
                    src="../img/freespirits/drawing.webp"
                    alt="Scan of the hand-drawn logo that I used to create the final logotype."
                />
                <img
                    src="../img/freespirits/windowmockup.webp"
                    alt="Mockup of the final logotype on a window."
                />
                <h3>New FSD Identity</h3>
                <p>
                    After enduring the 2021 lockdown, they approached me again;
                    this time to create a more comprehensive identity that will
                    be better suited to their business direction moving forward.
                </p>
                <p>
                    They wanted to widen their audience and expand their
                    customer base, which involved creating a new, modern
                    identity that would be neutral in its style and easier to
                    use on social media and websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This involved adapting the work previously done on the brand
                    to a new design language. We endeavoured to create a more
                    professional feel to the company that would suit the
                    expansion of its business model.
                </p>

                />
                <p>
                    Following the launch of their website, I also advised the
                    business on their design moving forward. My responsibilities
                    were to design and oversee the production of social media
                    assets to ensure that the company maintained a strong look
                    and feel.
