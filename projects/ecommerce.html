                    The aims of this project are to reinforce the React learning
                    that I have been doing. Hopefully at the end of this project
                    I will be a much more experience developer. Things that will
                    be new to me in this project are:

                        Product Page (with id parameter) Similar to a product
                        page on another site, allows you to add to cart and

                <p>
                    All products should be stored in Firestore, you should store

                </ul>
                <p>
                    All data should be stored in Firestore and fetched by the
                    frontend, there should be NO static product data in the

                    have to check the current cart and the product quantity Cart
                    page should have the following:

                    This was the biggest React project that I have worked on so
                    far. Above is an example of the file structure that I ended
                    up using. The <code>components</code> folder was strictly
                    for components that would be used in more than one context.
                    The <code>routes</code> folder contained whole pages and
                    often many page-specific sub-components. I think this was an
                    okay way to structure my project. Being inexperienced with
                    projects this size, I&#39;m sure there are many better ways
                    to do things.

                <h3 id="using-local-storage">Using local storage</h3>
                <p>
                    Even though the project requirements mentions using the
                    firestore database to store favourited products, I opted to
                    use <code>localStorage</code> instead. There were a few
                    reasons that I broke the brief in this regard:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I wanted more experience working with the local
                            storage interface.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>
                            I wanted interaction like changing cart quantities
                            to be more responsive. I didn&#39;t want the app to
                            have to wait for the server for so many
                            interactions.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Integration the local storage interaction into already
                    cumbersome components was a little too cumbersome for me.
                    Which leads me to the next topic:
                </p>
                <h3 id="using-custom-hooks">Using custom hooks</h3>
                <p>
                    I found using custom hooks was a really good way of
                    abstracting logic and cleaning up repetitive boilerplate
                    code from components. With a project of this complexity, I
                    was looking for ways to keep components organised.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Although many of the hooks had <code>use</code> in the front
                    of their name, they were more similar to service functions.
                    They hid away the tedious tasks associated with dealing with
                    the <code>localStorage</code> API for example. They did
                    however, additionally manage any related state that the
                    component will need to use, which in my opinion qualifies
                    them to be react hooks.

                    While I&#39;m not totally satisfied with the end-result,
                    there were a few tricks that I think improved the look of
                    the website.

                    Using the CSS <code>filter</code> property on product
                    thumbnails.
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Using product thumbnails with a white background on a page
                    with a white background is not my kind of aesthetic. Seeing
                    the edges of the images reinforces the grid and is much more
                    pleasing to the eye. Using
                    <code>filter: brightness()</code> we can reduce the maximum
                    white point of the image. This works particularly well on
                    images with a white background as you get a uniform
                    off-white, which is a popular background on many online
                    stores.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the general sense, having the product thumbnails be
                    uniform in their background and styling is the best --
                    albeit high effort -- way to improve the look of your
                    ecommerce store.

                    Embracing imperfect grids
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Given my design style, I was previously obsessed with making
                    sure the left and right edges of every element on the page
                    line up. However, with a grid of elements, this introduces
                    an interesting conundrum. Resizing the page would either
                    stretch the aspect ratio of the elements in your grid (no
                    doubt creating some image scaling weirdness), or create
                    large gaps between each column.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this project I decided to let my worries go and have a
                    fixed gap between each column. While the grid never quite
                    touches the edges of the container, it looks much better
                    than any solution that I&#39;ve tried before.

                <h4 id="complexity">Complexity</h4>
                <p>
                    The hardest part of this project for me was managing
                    complexity. With each route (such as the Product Page) being
                    so complex on their own, I wasn&#39;t having the best time
                    trying to manage the complexity of some of the components. I
                    think in the future, I will be way more willing to create
                    sub components when I anticipate that things will get too
                    complicated, instead of waiting until they get too much and
                    then having to refactor afterwards.
                </p>
                <h4 id="readability">Readability</h4>
                <p>
                    I find JSX hard to read, especially with big components.
                    Halfway through the project, I realised how much time I was
                    spending scrolling through my components, so I went through
                    and added comments to split up the JSX by section.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When it comes to the rest of the functional component, I did
                    the same, splitting the function into sections delineated by
                    the purpose of the code (e.g. one section would be an
                    <code>isFavourited</code> state and the relevant event
                    handlers). In the future I will also split up the useEffects
                    into all the different sections as well (I know thats kind
                    of the whole point of react hooks but I forgot).
                </p>
                <h4 id="scss">SCSS</h4>
                <p>
                    The styling ended up being a disaster. While I did use SCSS
                    modules, I neglected to create a variables or mixins file,
                    which I will definitely do in the future if I end up using
                    sass in another React project. Another way that I would
                    address this is using Styled Components, which I learnt for
                    a subsequent project. Styled Components have a theme
                    provider that allows you to styles like colours.
                </p>
                <h4 id="custom-hooks">Custom Hooks</h4>
                <p>
                    One criticism that I received for my implementation of
                    custom hooks was that it potentially made the code less
                    explicit. Without having the logic present in the function,
                    you need very well-named variables to communicate to another
                    programmer what the hook does.

                <p>If I were to work on this project any further I would:</p>

                    <li>Clean up SCSS.</li>
                    <li>
                        Fix some strange input behaviour with the order
                        quantities.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Add a feature that would allow an administrator to
                        replenish stock and add/remove products.

                    <li>React can get really hard for big projects.</li>
                    <li>
                        JSX got really messy but I fixed it mostly with
                        commenting and some sub components.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        SCSS got really messy but it was so messy I didn&#39;t
                        bother to fix it.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Created some custom hooks. Mostly to use localStorage.

                        Use Styled Components to make my styling simpler and
                        DRYer.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make sub components BEFORE things get messy.</li>
                    <li>
                        Make sure that my custom hooks are well-named or
                        thoroughly documented so other developers know what is
                        going on.
